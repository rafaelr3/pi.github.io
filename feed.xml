  <p>The problem is that industrial culture is based on a mode of mimesis that simulates itself over and over again. In our emerging global society, the human being stands in the middle of a “fun zone” with walls of mirrors, where one’s reflection is all-too- human. Something is behind these human images-a psychology that supports a mimesis that fails to recognize its origin, and, therefore, it downplays the sensuous life.</p>

  <p>Computers, video, radio, printing presses, synthesizers, fax machines, tape recorders, photocopiers - these things make good toys, but terrible addictions.</p>

  <p>Finally we realize we cannot “reach out &amp; touch someone” who is not present in the flesh. These media may be useful to our art - but they must not possess us, nor must they stand between, mediate, or separate us from our animal/animate selves. We want to control our media, not be controlled by them. And we should like to remember a certain psychic martial art which stresses  the realization that the body itself is the least mediated of all media.</p>

  <p>For art, the intervention of Capital always signals a further degree of mediation. To say that art is commodified is to say that a mediation, or standing-inbetween, has occurred, &amp; that this betweenness  amounts to a split, &amp; that this split amounts to “alienation.”</p>

<p>I would like to thank Aaron Cheak for this wonderful translation from Henry Corbin.  The selections get to the heart of Corbin’s understanding of alchemy. It resonates with the process of concrescence in Alfred North Whitehead.  It breaks from any materialism and from any spiritualism.  It seeks what Roland Faber writes as the intermezzo, the in-between. It is wholistic, in each different, with resonances when we relate with one another.</p>

<p>A wonderful quote on defining/experiencing/participating in alchemy:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Not only does it contain a mine of information, it is eminently representative of a conception of alchemy that is neither a simple dramaturgy of the unconscious or psychological allegory, nor a simple manipulation of materials practiced in the manner of a mere chemist or pharmacist. It is an operation at once material and spiritual, the juncture between the two aspects remaining the hidden secret underneath the symbols of the “Philosophers” (as the alchemists designate themselves). And because the <em>ars hieratica</em> integrates the two operations, its locus is in fact a mesocosm (<em>intermonde</em>), of which the ritual form and the cadre of a temple are the best means of imposing the integral representation.</p>
