  <p>The problem is that industrial culture is based on a mode of mimesis that simulates itself over and over again. In our emerging global society, the human being stands in the middle of a “fun zone” with walls of mirrors, where one’s reflection is all-too- human. Something is behind these human images-a psychology that supports a mimesis that fails to recognize its origin, and, therefore, it downplays the sensuous life.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Aaron Cheak for this wonderful translation from Henry Corbin.  The selections get to the heart of Corbin’s understanding of alchemy. It resonates with the process of concrescence in Alfred North Whitehead.  It breaks from any materialism and from any spiritualism.  It seeks what Roland Faber writes as the intermezzo, the in-between. It is wholistic, in each different, with resonances when we relate with one another.</p>

<p>A wonderful quote on defining/experiencing/participating in alchemy:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Not only does it contain a mine of information, it is eminently representative of a conception of alchemy that is neither a simple dramaturgy of the unconscious or psychological allegory, nor a simple manipulation of materials practiced in the manner of a mere chemist or pharmacist. It is an operation at once material and spiritual, the juncture between the two aspects remaining the hidden secret underneath the symbols of the “Philosophers” (as the alchemists designate themselves). And because the <em>ars hieratica</em> integrates the two operations, its locus is in fact a mesocosm (<em>intermonde</em>), of which the ritual form and the cadre of a temple are the best means of imposing the integral representation.</p>

Here it goes:</p>

<h3 id="seek-me-in-the-mystical-abode-of-love-">“Seek Me in the Mystical Abode of Love “</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>But, whoever dares to carry out this search will find himself obliged to defy the norms and forms of thought in the common, socialized forms of religion, and his proposals will sound like paradoxes (the <em>shath</em> of which Ruzbehan was so fond). To remain faithful, with absolute sincerity, to the presence of his ‘inner’ God, one may have to accept being taken for a ‘black sheep’ in the eyes of ‘right thinking’ Muslims. Such was the case with those called <em>maldmati</em> among whom we find Hafiz. Now, Ruzbehan tells us a detail about himself which really underlines his affinity with Hafiz. He mentions this on the occasion of one of his visions when the contradiction between the Unique and the Multiple was resolved for him; a contradiction that exoteric theology is powerless to overcome, since it recedes before it:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the days of my youth, met a shaykh who was a man of great mystic science, a <em>maldmati</em> shaykh, whose true face was unperceived by the mass of mankind. One night, I was contemplating a vast plain in the plains of Mystery when suddenly, on the approaches to that plain, I saw God in the guise of that shaykh. As I came up to him, he made a sign to me, showing me another plain. I advanced towards this plain and I saw a similar shaykh and again the shaykh was God. He made another sign, showing me another plain, and so on, until he had disclosed seventy thousand plains to me, and each time a plain drew nearer, I saw a figure similar to the one I had seen first. I said to myself: And yet, God the Most High is unique, one, indivisible, transcending (<em>monazzah</em>) small or large numbers, along with equals, contraries and similars. Then I was told: such are the theophanies of the eternal Attributes, they are boundless. At that moment, I felt the gripping presence of the esoteric realities of tawhid from the sea of Magnificence.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The meaning of this vision is perfectly clear. The plurality of limitless theophanies - a stumbling block for the naive consciousness which would simply see polytheism in it - is resolved each time into being the multiplication of unity by itself, the product of which is always and each time a unity, that is, the unity of the Contemplating and the Contemplated. Such is the visionary mode, a mode which enables the mystic to re-discover in the creature the secret of the Uncreated, without negative theology nor a dialectic of the inaccessible. Recounting another vision in which the whole series of divine Attributes corresponding to the human form were revealed to him, and having been admitted to take part in a mysterious divine Supper, Ruzbehan exclaims: “My God, you nevertheless transcend the act of eating and drinking. If the tears of repentance are the drink of Angels, what of the tears of desire and intimacy shed at the time of the Vision?” “And He said: ‘that is my drink.”</p>

<p>Reading Amy Kind and Peter Kung’s magnificent edited work <em>Knowledge Through Imagination</em>, and am thinking through it’s implications.  For Kind/Kung, their goal in the text is to lift up the instructive implications of the imagination over and beyond the transcendent capabilities.</p>

<p>The problem with the transcendent capabilities of the imagination is its ability to disengage with the limitations of this worldly experience.  That is, there are no constraints in the transcendent imagination (fantasy).  This poses problems for both Kind/Kung because knowledge formation cannot find its derivation in the imagination.  Kind/Kung look to find compatibility within the two forms of imagination by turning the faculty of imagination into a constrained imagination, limited by the ideas and things that the self gives into it.  This allows for a focused thought for possibility in accessing new knowledge.</p>

<p>Although I am fond of it, and do not neglect it (I think this is necessary!), I see that what is missing is a relational approach to the imagination that is more known in the works of John Sallis, and hidden within Alfred North Whitehead’s work.  It is a relational imagination which blurs the boundary between transcendent and instructive, and allows for the connections of other actual occasions, entities, to dictate and develop knowledge.  For instance, Sallis calls for a form of gazing at a space, which is the entrance to the imagination, as gazing provides the space for in depth viewing of the entity down to the elementals, the most basic of all things.  And even then we are not seeing the origins, but rather the manifestations of the entity realized, the thing in itself.</p>

<p>Alfred North Whitehead offers a similar response in the concrescing of actual occasions, in which they become possibilities seeking a response.  Instead of beings, we are becomings, always in process, and thus always being introduced into possibilities.  Experiences therefore become important for our becoming, to be prehended and felt for a form of analysis towards satisfaction.  But in our becoming we are just possibilities waiting to become.  And when we become, we become actual, a datum for every other becoming.  This is the imaginative generalization of actual occasions Whitehead is trying to get at: we are imaginative becomings, not repetitions, but becoming new at each moment because we are not the exact same things pertaining to time and space.  The facts that we categorize are “bare facts” to Whitehead, and thus have a facticity because of the evaluation we give to it.  It becomes valuable.  And thus what we value is because of an imaginative undertaking of imaginative feeling, one that is not untrue, but is not yet fully realized.  This makes it both transcendent and instructive, as we have not yet been (becoming, transcendent), and yet is instructive for the future of the actual occasion as a datum for feeling (the superjective feeling of the actual occasion as actualized).  So for Whitehead imagination is integral for any becoming for without it, the act of becoming is mere repetition.</p>

<p>In describing his Speculative Philosophy, Alfred North Whitehead shapes two categories; a rational side and empirical side.  The rational is that of analysis: the empirical, that of value, importance.</p>

<p>The rational side in his metaphysics, or speculative philosophy, is found in the terms coherence and logic (consistency), “a coherent, logical, necessary system of general ideas in terms of which every element of our experience can be interpreted.” Working with Michel Weber’s text, <em>Whitehead’s Pancreativism: The Basics</em>, I hope to better understand what Whitehead is trying to do in his formation of Speculative Philosophy of Process.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Rational-Coherence</strong> - that the fundamental notions presuppose one another so that one cannot be explained without the other.  This does not mean that they cannot be defined, but rather to get a deeper picture one needs both, the relationship between the two.</li>
  <li><strong>Rational-Consistency</strong> - logical consistency, lack of categorical contradiction, that things do not contradict one another. Under logic (consistency) there is the natural turn to describe the need for non-contradiction, that it makes sense and it flows.  However, Whitehead does not want Speculative Philosophy to function with logic as its primacy.  Weber places logical consistency under a Weak request for Whitehead, as he argues that mathematics and science, in the fallacy of misplaced concreteness, moves solely towards logic in describing the universe; there is a needs for logic consistency, but not forsaking the other contents, that of applicability and adequacy.  There is a need for a democracy, a harmonization of the scheme, which calls for a strong coherence. The goal for coherence is interdependence and independence in categorization.  Categories are independent in that they are not definable in terms of the other, understood.  But to say that the specific category is all there is is a fallacy precisely because of its interconnectedness, or its relation to other categories.  This is where interdependence comes in.  As Whitehead states, “The coherence…is the discovery that the process, or concrescence of any one actual entity involves the other actual entities among its components.  In this way the obvious solidarity of the world receives its explanation.”(ANW 7) The Actual entities presuppose one another or else they are meaningless.  There is an interlocking web, such that experience is caught in it; however, the Actual entities need not deal with the same terminology, with the same forms of abstraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Empirical- applicable</strong> - (weak request) that some data are interpretable</li>
  <li><strong>Empirical- adequate</strong> - (strong request) that all data is able to be interpreted. On the empirical side, there is a need for “interpretative power,”  meaning that the concept should be “measured by its capacity of directing observation and immediate experience,” (Weber 97).  Applicability deals with its faithfulness to the notion of its logic: does experience coincide with the model presented in the concept?  Adequacy deals with every experience having its place in the general scheme of things.  And by adequacy, it does not mean if the experience recieved was adequate enough to be in the model, but rather that every experience one experiences gets categorized in some way, not to be placed in a hierarchical scheme, but to find its “semantic” niche in the framework.  It forces a renewal of the concept, just as in applicability, precisely because on every new experience it must be re-analyzed, it must find a logical coherence, thus looking at its applicability and adequacy.</li>
  <li><strong>Necessity - necessary</strong> - “The doctrine of necessity in universality means that there is an essence to the universe which forbids relationships beyond itself, as a violation of its rationality” (ANW 4). The question then becomes of necessity.  What is its importance in this scheme?  “The doctrine of necessity in universality means that there is an essence to the universe which forbids relationships beyond itself, as a violation of its rationality” (ANW 4).  This suggests that the rational and empiricial side are both necessary components, not a combination, but two necessary components in the flow of process.  It is the hope of not finding any more elements of experience that are not capable of being placed within a scheme of generalization.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Radical Empiricism</strong> - Whitehead proposes that we always begin with our own subjective experiences, not because we are superior and thus we generate our thoughts, or that we have a thought which describes the object, but rather the opposite; it is precisely because we construct our thoughts from an external experience from the experience of the object, that we derive a subjective experience, and the claim that we can make the proposition that how we experience is how all things experience, albeit from different degrees.</p>

<p>Another important thing to note is that Whitehead incorporates the withness of the body as the way we experience.  He breaks the confines of sense perception of five senses, of the extero-perceptions, and includes the roots of it: the intero-perceptive and propio-perceptive data, in which allow us to feel with our bodies as well as have a sense of depth and space.  Thus we feel with our bodys, within as well as from with out.  Thus sense-perception is extended beyond our sense of smell, taste, sight, and hearing, to the feeling components found within our bodies as well as without, as well as the sense of space and depth.</p>

<p><strong>Reformed Subjectivist Principle</strong> - The RSP is the culmination of two points, the first is that unlike Hume, experience comes first and thus helps to form conscious experience, the culmination of experience.  The self must be open to the world to be able to recieve experiences other than its own, which leads to the second principle, the sensationalist principle.  This states that the purpose of experience, its function, is to enjoy the experience as a datum, without any subjective form of reception.  Only when one experiences the datum as datum can one begin to formulate a subjective experience.  Thus consciousness is the culmination of experience and not the foundation of experience.  It is in the experience of the object that the subject constructs an emotive and/or purposive form, which is why it can be said that the objects themselves must not be vacuous entities in themselves.</p>

<p>The subjectivist principle also looks to say that since we start from our own experiences, we can say that our own experiences from the subject are experiences of all subjects.  My subjective experience, the method by which I experience, is also the method by which all subjects experience and emanate from.</p>

<p>This discussion is highlighted in Shaviro’s text, (Shaviro, <em>Without Criteria</em>, 11).  Whitehead reverses Kant’s critique of experience, that it moves from subjectivity into objectivity.  It is as if I take the object and develop my experience of it and then place it upon that object.  This creates the fallacy that I do not affect the world around me.  Quite the contrary.  It is because of my relation to said object that I am able to prehend the object, to feel it, as well as sense it through sight, smell, etc., that I formulate the subjective experience, or the subject itself.  From the many become one and are then increased by one.</p>

<p>Thus when the subject constructs, it is always from experience, from the processual flux.  We emerge from it as subject, but even from that point we become part of the manyness of process, a datum for other occasions.</p>

<p><strong>Difference</strong> - We see by difference, we are able to experience by the difference we experience.</p>

<p><strong>Imaginative Generalization</strong> - However, difference hides, and it hides the relations between the two.  Imaginative generalization allows for the refreshing of terms and ideas from one category to another.  The goal is not to deduce, to deconstruct to get to the ground, but rather to see what happens when ideas from one group is engaged in another group.  What happens?  Does it make sense?</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="imagination" /><category term="creativeimagination" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[5 axioms of alfred north whitehead's speculative philosophy]]></summary></entry></feed>
