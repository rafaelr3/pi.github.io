# hakim bey, immediatism, 8-9.

> Computers, video, radio, printing presses, synthesizers, fax machines, tape recorders, photocopiers - these things make good toys, but terrible addictions.

> Finally we realize we cannot â€œreach out & touch someone" who is not present in the flesh. These media may be useful to our art - but they must not possess us, nor must they stand between, mediate, or separate us from our animal/animate selves. We want to control our media, not be controlled by them. And we should like to remember a certain psychic martial art which stresses  the realization that the body itself is the least mediated of all media.
