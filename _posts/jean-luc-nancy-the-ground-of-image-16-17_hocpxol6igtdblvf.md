> violence does not participate in any order of reasons...it denatures, wrecks, massacres that which it assaults...it is not the stupidity that comes from a lack of intelligence, but much worse: it is the stupidity of _le con_. It is the calculated absence of thought willed by rigid intelligence.

In the moments of peaceful protest due to the murder of George Floyd, among the many more African Americans that have died due to police violence, I reflect on the above quote as poignant and reveals to us the problem. When persons of authority exert violence on the innocent, when they try to exert their power, they no longer "participate in any order of reasons,"  not thinking but having a rigid intelligence. Rigid. This exists in all systems of authority that fail to realize their role to serve people, and not themselves.
