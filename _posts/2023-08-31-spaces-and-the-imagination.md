quote about imagination lost because we do not have a chance to break out of space, or to find space

space in bachelard
In the _Poetics of Space_ Gaston Bachelard uses the space of the home as a space of development.  It is not solely as physical reality, but also a psycological and emotional one that can shape our thoughts, memories and dreams.  He says that the imagination envelopes everything in, around and of the home, so that it goes beyond the actual into the possible, so that something becomes of it, some meaning, a memory becomes of it.

metaphor for understanding the self, and the development of self.  But what is of interest to me here is the use of the home as space. focus on space. uses a home to explain the depths of the mind.  in order to reflect upon it, the home is covered, a deleuzian veil so that the metaphorical, the imaginative or the imaginary can come into focus. It moves one beyond the actual to the possible. the use of stairs, the attic, the rooms, the basement, all play a part.

Bachelard identifies four fundamental types of space:

Intimate space: This is the space of our homes, our bedrooms, and our childhood memories. It is a space of security and comfort, where we can feel protected from the outside world.
Amenable space: This is the space of nature, of forests and fields and mountains. It is a space of freedom and possibility, where we can experience the vastness of the world.
Symbolic space: This is the space of art, of literature, and of religion. It is a space of dreams and imagination, where we can explore the deeper meaning of life.
Limitless space: This is the space of the universe, of stars and galaxies and black holes. It is a space of mystery and awe, where we can contemplate the vastness of existence.
Bachelard argues that these four types of space are not mutually exclusive. They can overlap and interact with each other in complex ways. For example, our intimate space can be shaped by our experiences in nature, and our symbolic space can be informed by our understanding of limitless space.

Bachelard's work has been influential in a variety of fields, including architecture, psychology, and literary criticism. It has helped us to understand the ways in which space can shape our lives, both consciously and unconsciously.

Here are some specific examples of what Bachelard says about space in The Poetics of Space:

"The house is our first universe." The house is the first space that we come to know intimately. It is a place of security and comfort, where we can feel protected from the outside world. Our memories of our childhood homes can shape our sense of self and our relationships with others.
"The intimate space shelters us from the immensity of the world." The intimate space is a place where we can feel safe and secure. It is a place where we can retreat from the vastness of the world and the challenges of life.
"The house is the first cosmos." The house is a miniature universe, with its own rooms, corridors, and attics. It is a place where we can explore our imaginations and create our own worlds.
"The house is the first dream." The house is a place where we can dream our dreams. It is a place where we can escape from the everyday world and enter into a world of fantasy and possibility.
Bachelard's work on space is a rich and complex exploration of the relationship between human beings and the spaces they inhabit. It is a work that has had a profound impact on our understanding of space and its role in our lives.

space in whitehead
Space in whitehead functions a bit different.  both context and distance play a part in the process of space.  time is also included.  the imagination, the imaginary, or creativity, takes into account a multitude of factors to come towards a satisfaction (satisfaction as a culminating moment in the act of becoming).

space in corbin?
corbin space and the performative, where action takes place, where understanding becomes.  we are invited to be a part of the play, the drama that unfolds.

why important
to be bound by a context forces creativity to come into action, to make best what can be done.  Most of ones understanding of the imagination is from those who are held in certain contexts, whether benefitting from academia, wealth, etc.  Imagination is limited by the context one exists in.  thus the type of house one had growing up is the context by which our imaginative becoming derives.  But does the limitation of space also predetermine or limit what one can understand? Or are the values that are unfolded within the context the limiting factor? moved by whitehead about the stranger and the opening of adventure.
