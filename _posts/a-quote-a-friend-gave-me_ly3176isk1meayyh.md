# a quote a friend gave me

This quote was given to me by a friend, as I was passing through (and still am) going through a difficult transition.  The reality is, this quote hurts. It bothers me. But at the same time, it is very process oriented, and therefore I return to it. I argue with it, but it remains.  Here is the quote:

> To live is to die a thousand deaths to the person I used to be. I die when I accept that I will never be the person I wanted to grow up to be. My task, however, is just to travel between each version of myself and honor what emerges along the way.

May your journey, in whatever phase it is in, may it be forgiving, may it be stretching, and may you find the joyful moments within them.
