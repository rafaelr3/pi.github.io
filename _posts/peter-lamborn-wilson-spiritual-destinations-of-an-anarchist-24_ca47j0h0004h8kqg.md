> Each of us are a part of Nature, it is true, but our value as individuals is not thereby lessened in any way, since it would be equally true to say that Nature is a part of us, individually. Nature's freedom from all abstract "categorical imperatives" does not reduce all biota to a faceless mass; on the contrary, it restores to each thing its own unique face.
