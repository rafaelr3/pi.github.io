quote, spirit chapter, constructive theology, 247

> The spirit hollows and haunts, moans and mobilizes, in people's and cultures baptized and not. A Hindu Gandhi as well as an Egyptian Anthony, and apparition of Kali as well as a vision of Guadalupe, an event like breaking bread as well as breaking tyranny, _haiku_ as much as romantic poesy, all these persons and events may become the place of being inspired, being inspirited, a holy inhabitation.
