# quote, from a course i gave in eco-theology

> "Appetition can also mean construction, the process of prehending a datum for feeling, taking things in, digesting. The reason for this is that to construct something one needs materials and to build what is being expressed.  It is more than a postmodern shifting of objects and makes something new; we digest it in our senses, our mind does something with it, we construct."


_I was trying to describe Alfred North Whitehead's term "Appetition" and how it resonates with George Steiner's understanding of Digestion vs. Consumption.  Appetition is necessarily a part of life; it is, in a very real way, to relate, to prehend, to take in, to chew on things, to take in deeply of its nourishment, its enjoyments, its consequences. It allows one to construct._
