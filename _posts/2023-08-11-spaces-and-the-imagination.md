quote about imagination lost because we do not have a chance to break out of space, or to find space

space in bachelard
focus on space. uses a home to explain the depths of the mind.  in order to reflect upon it, the home is covered, a deleuzian veil so that the metaphorical, the imaginative or the imaginary can come into focus. It moves one beyond the actual to the possible. the use of stairs, the attic, the rooms, the basement, all play a part.

space in whitehead
Space in whitehead functions a bit different.  both context and distance play a part in the process of space.  time is also included.  the imagination, the imaginary, or creativity, takes into account a multitude of factors to come towards a satisfaction (satisfaction as a culminating moment in the act of becoming).

space in corbin?
corbin space and the performative, where action takes place, where understanding becomes.  we are invited to be a part of the play, the drama that unfolds.

why important
to be bound by a context forces creativity to come into action, to make best what can be done.  Most of ones understanding of the imagination is from those who are held in certain contexts, whether benefitting from academia, wealth, etc.  Imagination is limited by the context one exists in.  thus the type of house one had growing up is the context by which our imaginative becoming derives.  But does the limitation of space also predetermine or limit what one can understand? Or are the values that are unfolded within the context the limiting factor? moved by whitehead about the stranger and the opening of adventure.
