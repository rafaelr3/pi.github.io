# quote, catherine keller, on the mystery, 17.

> Anselm classically defined theology as _fides quarens intellectum_--"faith seeking understanding." Not faith that already understands and so no longer needs to seek. That would by definition no longer be theology. Theology is not itself the faith but its quest. If we stop seeking, we are no longer on the way. Faith seeking understanding has then turned into "belief that understands." It then closes the very root of _quarens_, from which come both _question_ and _quest_.
