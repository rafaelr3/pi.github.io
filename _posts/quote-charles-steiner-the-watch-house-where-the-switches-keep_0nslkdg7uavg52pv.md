quote, charles steiner, the watch house where the switches keep

> There is a "bad" eternity: the quasi-atemporality of half-inhabited images; of concepts believed; of institutions imposed. There is a "good" eternity unveiled when energy is released, where the Now abides at the very center of the transitory
