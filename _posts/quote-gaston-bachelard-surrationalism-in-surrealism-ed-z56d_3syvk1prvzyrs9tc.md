# quote, gaston bachelard, "surrationalism", in _surrealism_, ed. julien levy, 188.

> There should be no hesitation: one should choose the side where one thinks the most, where one experiments the most artificially, where ideas are the least viscous, where reason loves to be in danger. _If, in any experiment, one does not risk one's reason, that experiment is not worthwhile attempting._
