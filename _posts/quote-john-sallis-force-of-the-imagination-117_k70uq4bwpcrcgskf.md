## quote, john sallis, force of the imagination, 117.

>...vision is binocular, that hearing is biaural, that one touches with two hands--this already disturbs the simplicity and stability that the frontal aspect could otherwise seem to possess, especially at a level prior to the workings of horizonality. Already with the binocular image, for instance, there will have been a minute difference of perspective and a corresponding protohorizonal operation.
In this regard the opening of the image onto the thing itself is always already under way...
