- _World Religions in the City: An Exploration in Diversity_
    -This course introduces the study and diversity of religion. It explores the major world religious traditions that are found throughout the life of the City: Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Bahaâ€™i. The course is interdisciplinary in that it includes material from historical, literary, philosophical, and theological insights into the world's religions.

    In a city where we are becoming increasingly aware of the cultural diversity and richness, exploring the religious life and consciousness of a people is one way of gaining access to that diversity. 

    Some questions we will explore in each tradition: How do people in each tradition articulate the central symbols, tenets, and practices of their faith in the context of the questions and challenges of the modern world? How do people in each tradition think about their own faith in the light of the diversity of other religious traditions? Is religious diversity and difference a problem? What is the spectrum of religious perspectives within each tradition?
