- Introduction to Philosophy
- Ancient and Medieval Philosophy
- Intro to Theological Education
- Practice of Prophetic Ministry
- __Rethinking Theological Imagination__
    - This seminar will look at the theological imagination, here defined as the space and force by which images and concepts of God are formed or understood. We will look at the axial shifts of thought which affect the Theological imagination in its medieval, modern and contemporary stages. We will discuss some of the components of Process thought and how it challenges or rethinks the theological imagination for our current time
- Eco-Theology
- Introduction to Theology (Systematic Theology)
- __Queer Theologies__
    - This is an introductory course that explores the aims and methods of queer theology. "Queer" theology transgresses and subverts dominant constructions of sexuality and gender identity, reinterpreting and reconstructing expressions of Christian thought and practice that forces one to rethink understandings of human life, community, and the divine.  We will explore “queer approaches” to theology, especially where notions of identity (esp. gender and sex, but also race, ethnicity, class, ability) are concerned. We will also look at arguments, as well as look beyond, concerning the inclusion of sexual minorities into Christian communities. In this course, we will learn to engage in "queering" Christian theology and biblical interpretation to inquire about the benefits and usefulness of queer theory as a tool for constructive theological projects and Christian practices.
- __World Religions in the City: An Exploration in Diversity__
    -This course introduces the study and diversity of religion. It explores the major world religious traditions that are found throughout the life of the City: Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Baha’i. The course is interdisciplinary in that it includes material from historical, literary, philosophical, and theological insights into the world's religions.

    In a city where we are becoming increasingly aware of the cultural diversity and richness, exploring the religious life and consciousness of a people is one way of gaining access to that diversity. 

    Some questions we will explore in each tradition: How do people in each tradition articulate the central symbols, tenets, and practices of their faith in the context of the questions and challenges of the modern world? How do people in each tradition think about their own faith in the light of the diversity of other religious traditions? Is religious diversity and difference a problem? What is the spectrum of religious perspectives within each tradition?

- Multifaith Critical Interpretation Seminar
- __Religious Pluralism, Truth and the Pluralist Imagination__
    - Religious Diversity is an actual fact and can also be a problem.  It is an actual fact because of what we experience in the complex reality of our world; it is a problem because of the interaction between religions; but more importantly, because of the interactions, and thus implications within religions.  The discussion of the manyness of religions lead to questions of the validity of religious truth: is it inclusive or exclusive? Who holds the ultimate truth?  But a more important question is involved: is religious diversity welcomed?  If so, is it to be accepted as an aspect of reality, or as an ideal that we move towards?
    
    This class will investigate diverse ways of describing and discussing the plurality and unity of religions by viewing it through the Pluralist Imagination, which maintains the position of relativity and plurality of truths.  We will also look at the paths of salvation/liberation, how the unity of religions can be conceptualized through a world theology.
