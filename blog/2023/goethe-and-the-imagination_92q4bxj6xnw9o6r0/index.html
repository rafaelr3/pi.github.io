<blockquote>
  <p>“A man born and bred up to the so-called exact sciences does not find it easy to realize, perched as he is on the heights of his own rationality, that there might also exist an exactitude of the imagination working through the senses, without which art would be simply unthinkable” (Aphorismen und Fragmente, Werke, Zürich, 1952, 17, 779)</p>
